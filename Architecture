# Architecture Document — RuDwaar OS (Prototype)

## Overview
The prototype is a modular, lightweight web API with the following components:
- Flask backend providing REST endpoints for advisory, marketplace, jobs, schemes navigator.
- Sample data in JSON to simulate farmers, produce listings, jobs, and government schemes.
- Simple rule-based logic for matchmaking and advisory to keep the prototype dependency-light.
- Tests using pytest.

## Components
1. **API Layer (Flask)** — Endpoints:
   - `/health` — status
   - `/advisory` — returns advisory based on crop and location (rule-based)
   - `/marketplace` — list and create produce listings
   - `/jobs` — post and list job requirements
   - `/schemes` — returns matched schemes (stubbed rules)

2. **Data Layer**
   - `sample_data/` contains sample JSON files that the API loads at startup.

3. **Business Logic**
   - Advisory: basic heuristics + sample rules for pest/weather guidance.
   - Matching: simple filter by skills/distance/wage range.

## Extensibility
- Replace rule-based advisory with ML models (TensorFlow/PyTorch) or call external APIs.
- Add authentication (JWT), RBAC for admin panel.
- Integrate a lightweight frontend (React/Flutter) and mobile offline sync.

## Deployment
- Containerize with Docker for production.
- Use a managed database (Postgres) and object storage for images.
